# Sorted Singly Linked List Operations  

## 📌 Introduction  
A **Sorted Singly Linked List** is a type of linked list where nodes are stored in **ascending (or descending) order** based on their data values.  
Insertion is performed in such a way that the list remains sorted at all times.  

Common real-life examples:  
- Maintaining a contact list in alphabetical order.  
- Leaderboards in gaming systems.  
- Scheduling tasks by priority.
